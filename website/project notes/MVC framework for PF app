MVC Design pattern for web app


Model
	does not know about view or controller

	Holds data about the user




View
	pageview.js

	- adds or removes table rows to the loan/asset tables
	- displays the calculation result and graph



Controller
	* knows about model and view

	- listens for some kind of event:

	A) on page load
		- initialize page load stuff
			- right now, not doing much here.
			- more important for when there is a user login process. not implemented yet.

	B) when add/subtract asset or loan is clicked
		- tell model to add/remove an asset/loan object
		- tell view to add a new row to the table of assets/loans

	C) when calculate is clicked

		- collect all form data 
		- submit it to the model
		- tell the model to calculate the result
		- tell the view to display the result
