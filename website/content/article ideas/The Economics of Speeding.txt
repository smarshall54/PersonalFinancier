The Economics of Speeding


- cumulative probability chart of likelihood of being pulled over vs marginal speed increase
- mins saved per mile travelled @ marginal mph over speed limit
	- correct for increased fuel mileage!?
- value of your time (cite YMOYL, chapter 7 give a re-read and show the maths in the article!)
- estimate the cost of a speeding ticket including insurance increases, etc.
- plot the optimal point at the intersection  of "dollar value of another minute of time" and "rate of speeding ticket acquisition"


- show all graphs
	- **tell the story** with graphs. dimensional analysis.
- show all math (i.e. to convert cuml. prob. to cost)
	- "prove" the story with the maths, i.e. just to show that it stands up to scrutiny.
- cite all sources

- reasearch data to get an estimate for the cuml. prob. curve for speeding
- research data for how much fuel efficiency is lost for every mph over 30, every mph over 55, every mph over 65 and apply this as a piecewise linear

- build spreadsheet to calculate it and post the file so users can input their own variables (like fine amounts for their state, person valuation of time, % on highway, city roads, country roads)
